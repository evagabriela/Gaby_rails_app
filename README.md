#Gaby's Ruby on Rails App:

After started working on RoR last August, I suddenly found myself in the interesting world of full stack web development.  I started realizing that there's much more than static pages and coding without testing happening there, and got interested in setting up my own full-RoR development stack to explore the possibilities of that (at the moment extremely excited) web development using TDD and other testing practices. 

I'm going to share my experiences while moving forward...

##What's the goal?
  Now that I've given a little bit of background, let me introduce you to the prototype project I'll be doing and posting more about my progress at my blog(codewithsalsa.tumblr.com) and here. For the moment, the idea is only to explore the possibilities of driven testing development and building using the object oriented mentality while building some basic functionality application on top of it (Sign in, Sign Up, Profile page, mini-posts, followers).
  
  For that purpose, I've set up the project's repository here on Github where you can track progress, and look for reference and code examples.
  
##Who is doing it?
  I've started with this to learn how to setup the complete RoR app, learn using TDD and other testing methodologies in the object oriented way, and also learn more the front-end implementation in a RoR app (using SASS and Javascript.
  
##What is next?
  This was just an introduction to give a little context around my future commits and posts on the subject of RoR and testing methodologies.  In the following posts, I'll be covering some specific parts of my code, challenges I've encountered, things I've tried, decisions I've made(and changes to those decisions that will happen).
  
  Posts that may be expected in the near future will cover the following topics: Setting up code in the object oriented way, tips and tricks of testing including jasmine (testing for javascript), coding Javascrip in the good way, JS libraries, and designing for a responsive web (including mobile) using Css and Javascript, and more to come as I'll be moving this thing forward.  

"The opportunities I am encountering to always learn something new, and calling it work, are one of the greatest gifts I am getting from the software developer world.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I do and I also hope you will join me on this journey" =)
